/**
 * The goal of this class is to only sell investments in small amounts, so that the entire {@link PortfolioOverview} is
 * not destabilized.
 * <p>
 * This is necessary, since Zonky only recalculates {@link PortfolioOverview} every 2 hours and investments sold before
 * the recalculation therefore cause {@link PortfolioOverview} to become out of sync with reality. Since the selling
 * operation is fundamentally asynchronous (we offer to sell, then someone in the future may decide to buy), we can not
 * "fix" portfolio on our side, as that would require us to constantly query for sold investments, making sure we have
 * included all of them in {@link PortfolioOverview}.
 * <p>
 * This throttle will make sure we only sell so much at once as not to affect the portfolio too much.
 * {@link SellingJob} will ensure that the operation happens often enough that even large selloffs can be accomplished
 * within days at worst.
