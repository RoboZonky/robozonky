 * {@link #abort()}. {@link #close()} will throw an {@link IllegalStateException} unless {@link #commit()} or
 * {@link #abort()} is called beforehand - this is to prevent the applications from leaving uncommitted data in there.
 * <p>
 * Every method not related to events or state will be delegated to the underlying {@link Tenant}.
