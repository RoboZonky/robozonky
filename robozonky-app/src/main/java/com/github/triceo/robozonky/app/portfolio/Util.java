     * Blocked amounts represent loans in various stages. Either the user has invested and the loan has not yet been
     * funded to 100 % ("na tržišti"), or the user invested and the loan has been funded ("na cestě"). In the latter
     * case, the loan has already disappeared from the marketplace, which means that it will not be available for
     * investing any more. As far as we know, the next stage is "v pořádku", the blocked amount is cleared and the loan
     * becomes an active investment.
     * <p>
     * Based on that, this method deals with the first case - when the loan is still available for investing, but we've
     * already invested as evidenced by the blocked amount. It also unnecessarily deals with the second case, since
     * that is represented by a blocked amount as well. But that does no harm.
     * <p>
     * In case user has made repeated investments into a particular loan, this will show up as multiple blocked amounts.
     * The method needs to handle this as well.
     * @param api Authenticated Zonky API to read data from.
     * @return Every blocked amount represents a future investment. This method returns such investments.
