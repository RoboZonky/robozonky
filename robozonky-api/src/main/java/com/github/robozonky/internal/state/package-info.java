/**
 * Provides means to persistently store information. Use
 * {@link com.github.robozonky.internal.state.TenantState#of(SessionInfo)} as primary entry
 * point.
 * <p>
 * This class uses two main concepts:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>A tenant is a single user of the application. All state is always specific to a tenant. A tenant is
 * represented by a {@link com.github.robozonky.api.SessionInfo} instance.</li>
 * <li>An instance is a {@link java.lang.Class} that is storing the state, as provided in
 * {@link com.github.robozonky.internal.state.TenantState#in(java.lang.Class)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * At the moment, there is only one implementation of these concepts, one backed by a file.
 * ({@link com.github.robozonky.internal.state.FileBackedStateStorage}, implementing the INI file format.) Every tenant
 * gets a single file, every instance then is a section in this file. Each such section is a fairly standard property
 * file.
