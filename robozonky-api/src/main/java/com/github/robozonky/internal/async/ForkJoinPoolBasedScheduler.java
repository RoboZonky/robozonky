/**
 * This attempts to provide functionality similar to {@link ScheduledExecutorService}, but with a fully configurable
 * underlying {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}. ({@link ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} does not really allow for scaling the
 * pool size as cached thread pool does.)
 * <p>
 * This is how it works:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Task scheduling is requested via {@link #submit(Runnable, Duration, Duration, Duration)}. The task has a delay
 * in which it should be started, as well as a delay between the finish of one tasks and the start of the next
 * consecutive task.</li>
 * <li>The task itself ("original task") will be executed on a given {@link ExecutorService}, but in order to implement
 * the other properties, we need to implement a level of indirection via {@link ScheduledExecutorService}.</li>
 * <li>First, a task is scheduled in the {@link ScheduledExecutorService}, which only tells the {@link ExecutorService}
 * to schedule the original task after the delay has passed.</li>
 * <li>At the end of original task's execution, another request is sent to the {@link ScheduledExecutorService} to again
 * schedule the original task with the {@link ExecutorService}, this time with the delay equal to the delay between the
 * tasks, as initially specified.</li>
 * </ul>
