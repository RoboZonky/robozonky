/**
 * Provides different {@link Scheduler} instances based on the needs of a particular task. There are three categories
 * of tasks:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #REALTIME} tasks are essentially just the primary and secondary marketplace checks, which
 * are absolutely necessary, must be scheduled immediately and processed as soon as possible. There will be a fixed
 * pool of 2 threads always available to execute these tasks, one for each marketplace. These tasks will get
 * {@link Thread#MAX_PRIORITY}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #SUPPORTING} tasks carry functionality which is still very important for the robot or for the user,
 * but can be postponed momentarily. These would be tasks such as selling participations or updating strategies from
 * a remote server. There will be 2 threads always available to execute these tasks, and they will be given
 * {@link Thread#NORM_PRIORITY}.</li>
 * <li>{@link #BACKGROUND} tasks carry functionality which is either unimportant or can be easily postponed. There will
 * be up to 1 thread available to execute these tasks, and it will be given {@link Thread#MIN_PRIORITY}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * None of these tasks are restricted from spinning up their own threads. In fact, many of the {@link #REALTIME}
 * and {@link #SUPPORTING} tasks may start entire {@link ForkJoinPool}s as a side-effect of using
 * {@link Stream#parallel()}.
 * <p>
 * Each of these tasks will use {@link ThreadPoolExecutorBasedScheduler} as its underlying {@link Scheduler}
 * implementation.
