/**
 * Used to represent a participation in the authenticated bit of the API. Even 
 * though the confusing name, this participation is also used to represent
 * participations of other users for a given loan.
 *
 * Beware, though, since selling a participation on the secondary marketplace
 * will result in that participation being replaced in the list of participations
 * under any given loan with a new one. So, while most of the participations will
 * have a creation date close to loan publishing date, occasionally some will be
 * much newer, indicating SMP transaction.
 *
 * To the best of our knowledge, there is no other way to detect such transactions
 * made by other users.
