/**
 * This class carries several enumeration-based fields. Some of the enums are extremely important to the core function
 * (such as {@link Rating}), while others ({@link Region}, {@link MainIncomeType}, {@link Purpose}) are only providing
 * additional metadata. If the important enums change, we need RoboZonky to fail. However, in case of the others, we
 * provide non-failing deserializers which handle the missing values gracefully and provide a message warning users that
 * something needs an upgrade.
